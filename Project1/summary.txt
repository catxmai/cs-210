Q1) add_to_frontier in searchGeneric doesn't evaluate/assign value, and pop() in search only popping the last in list so
the previous neighbors are being added onto continuously and frontier gets stuck.
Q2) I can't solve mine (let it ran for 30s and timed out) but the discussion on Piazza indicated that my board is in exclude list and the reason for it
so it's not a surprise. 
Q3) Other boards worked okay with timeout added.
Q4) If h(x)=0, it should be uniform cost and A* turns into BFS

Layout:

Everything should be the same like project description. I don't have any helper class. 

searchGeneric: A*, A*MPP
searchBFS: BFS, BFSMPP
driver: all 3 algos (A*, A*MPP, BFSMPP)

Heuristic for A*: Manhattan/.35
It's pretty simple and I didn't put much thought into it unfortunately. I consulted more here: http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html#S7
while I was searching for how to design heuristics. I tried the Euclidean one even tho Bloxorz specs don't fit just to see what's it like but it didn't work well.
I also tried different scaling factors for Manhattan distance. The 0.35 is through trials and doesn't mean anything.


Stats:
For board that has no solution but has expanded some path, my report won't show the number of expansion and just "-1". Stats won't include them.
Average expension per solution move:
BFSMPP: 5.208221378663108
A*: 597.6163356849916
A*MPP: 2.5728051866679684
